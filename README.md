### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

âš¡ I am a Senior Cloud Automation Engineer with the Cognizant Microsoft Business Group (formerly 10th Magnitude)

âš¡ I have been an avid user of Azure Pipelines and have my pipeline templates consolidated in my [pipeline-templates](https://github.com/joshjohanning/pipeline-templates) repo

âš¡ I use my [ghas-demo](https://github.com/joshjohanning/ghas-demo) repository for my GitHub Advanced Security Demo - see PDF [here](https://github.com/joshjohanning/ghas-demo/blob/main/GHAS%20Demo.pdf)

âš¡ I write blog posts every so often based on my DevOps experiences at [josh-ops.com](https://josh-ops.com)
